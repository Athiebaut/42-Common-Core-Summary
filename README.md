# 42-Common Core

Student at 42 Paris, a peer-to-peer coding school with a project-based, self-learning approach. Since joining, I have built a strong foundation in algorithmics, low-level programming (C/C++), object-oriented design, Unix systems, networking, cybersecurity, and fullstack web development.

✅ I successfully completed several hands-on technical projects, including:
– push_swap, minishell, ft_irc, Inception, Transcendence, etc.
– Working with tools like Docker, Git, SQLite, Fastify, WebSockets, and more
– Developing fully functional applications, network servers, and secure containers
